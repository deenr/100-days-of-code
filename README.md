# 100 Days of Web Development

This is a personal challenge I am undertaking to improve my skills in web development over the course of 100 days. In this repository, I will be documenting my progress, sharing my code, and reflecting on what I have learned.

## Why am I doing this?

## Why am I doing this?
I am undertaking this challenge for several reasons: 
1. To **improve my skills** in web development and become more proficient in the tools and technologies that are commonly used in the industry.
2. To develop code that not only **showcases my abilities** but also **demonstrates my work** to potential employers. 
3. To develop the **habit of consistent**, deliberate practice that will help me **achieve my goals** in the long term.

## Rules
The rules of this challenge are simple:
- **Code every day** for the next 100 days.
- Each day's code should be related to web development.

I will be using a variety of resources to guide my learning, including online courses, tutorials, and documentation. I will also be experimenting with my own projects and ideas, and seeking feedback from others in the web development community.

## Progress
I will be updating this repository daily with my progress. Feel free to follow along, offer feedback, or even join me on this challenge!
